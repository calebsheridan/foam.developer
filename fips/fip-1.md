## What is an FIP?

FIP stands for FOAM Improvement Proposal. A FIP is a design document providing information to the FOAM community, or describing a new feature for FOAM or its processes or environment. The FIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The FIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## FIP Rationale

We intend FIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into FOAM. Because the FIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

For FOAM implementers, FIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the FIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.
